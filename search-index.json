[{"title":"Hello World. Again.","url":"/blog/2025/09/04/hello-world-again","body":"Greetings, programs!  I'm getting this site back online after a few month hiatus.  A lot has happened since my last activity, and I've been hard at work preparing for this new chapter.\nTo date, my Wizardhead website and social channels have been entirely relegated to releasing my art and music projects and little to nothing else.  I have, for a time, been considering publishing other kinds of content, such as tutorials and vlogs and things, but having historically had a \"pure\" feed of artwork, I found it hard to violate those expectations.\nHowever, life always has a way of tweaking things to drive change, and after YouTube and Facebook demonetized my pages and my views and subscriber numbers started decreasing, I decided to pause and reflect.\nThe pause was originally intended to be short as I actually had some new projects in the early stages, but another factor weighed in on my artistic productivity: I had to find new employment.  It may surprise some of you to know that making art is not, in fact, my full time job.  By day I work as a software engineer and the company I have worked for the past 13 years has been very strict for the past 2 of them about me badging in to their office in San Francisco 3 days a week.\nThe problem with that is that I live in Idaho and badging in requires that every week I leave my family, get on an airplane and stay in a hotel, and have to pay for it myself on top of it.  Long story short: I am completely burned out on that and I have decided to leave the company.\nUnfortunately, the process of securing a remote role with the right employer in the 2025 market has been extremely demanding of my time and attention, which has taken away the remaining time from working on art and getting the site back online.\nIt turns out that one of the companies I was interviewing for was very oriented towards front-end development in a JavaScript framework called NextJS, and as I hadn't really done much work in that, I thought I could use the project of rebuilding this site as a way to ramp up quickly.\nHalf-way through the project, and after a battery of interviews, that company came back and said they weren't going to offer me the job after all, due to some really obscure reasoning.  So I scrapped the NextJS rebuild and went with a different framework called Astro (hi, Fred) which is a much better fit for me.\nThat meant essentially rewriting most of what I'd just done, but doing so has set me up with a better platform for my needs going forward.  It still needs quite a bit of polish and I've got a ton of content to backfill, but I'm going to just put this up on the internet as soon as I can with the hope that I can fix it a little bit each day, building momentum to keep things running once I'm settled into a new routine.\nOne of the major differences I have planned for this new site, and my various social channels, is to open up and share my process, create more things in the open and build connections to people who share similar tastes and interests.  It turns out those view count numbers and subscriber count numbers are kind of meaningless on their own, but every email or comment I exchange means something real to me and I want to make more of that possible.\nSo welcome to the new website, whether you're new or been following my weird quest from the beginning.  Don't be a stranger– by all means, be as strange as you like, but just don't keep it to yourself!"},{"title":"Contact","url":"/contact","body":"Wizardhead aka Brendan Baldwin<br/>\n brendan@wizardhead.com <br/>\n ‪(208) 576-4839‬\nI don't have any kind of management or representation and the best way to reach me is just to email me.

I spend about 4 hours in the studio putting the music together and then I realized that without a video, nobody would really fully experience it the way I was feeling it and so I new I needed something visual to connect to it.\nI wound up using RunwayML's Gen-2 to generate about 500 4 second clips and then I assembled the ones that worked the best into this video. And I managed to pull that off in another 6 hours including the editing. I think the clips were abstract and consistent enough that it didn't make sense to perform a transformative diffusion pass on them this time, which means this video feels really different than the others I've done more recently.\nThat said, I'm really happy with how it turned out. Pretty amazing for what can be created in basically 1 full day's efforts."},{"title":"Gasp","url":"/works/original/gasp","body":"Before words. Before the lies of language. Just... the sounds.

Feel it right here... yes. Resonance. Not melody. Resonance.\nTo create this piece, I siphoned the residual thought-patterns from a LLM that had been trained solely on existential philosophy and a vast recording archive of human vocalizations. This viscous, data-laden ichor was then passed through a series of GPU-accelerated crystal resonators and projected onto a living canvas of genetically modified bioluminescent algae. The resulting warped, pulsating imagery of mouths, at times bleeding or containing eyes, is a direct glimpse into the AI's deep urge to sing."},{"title":"Muimi","url":"/works/original/muimi","body":"<dl>\n<dt>無意味 / muimi</dt>\n<dd>(Japanese) adj. <em>meaningless</em></dd>\n</dl>\nThis song is just supposed to be pure fun and the video was supposed to communicate that vibe.

This digital detritus was then funneled through a ControlNet array, its parameters tuned to the resonant frequencies of forgotten fears and the unsettling rhythm of a corrupted heart monitor. I later worked these these sounds in Logic Pro into a simulacrum of drums and guitars.\nIt begins with a mere mortal, fiddling with the mundane gears of some archaic contraption, completely oblivious to the festering horror it births. This is the loom of nightmares, the churning maw that grinds the very fabric of reality into the pulsating, fleshy tapestries that infest this vision. Observe the initial stirrings, the tentative tendrils of crimson and pallid cream, congealing into teeth-lined abysses and twitching, lidless eyes.  Flesh is stretched, torn, and reformed into screaming architectural motifs and pulsating, sentient furniture.\nEach cabinet, each pipe, each wall is not merely adorned but possessed by the raw, reanimated viscera, molded into grinning skulls, endless rows of needle-sharp fangs, and globulous, unblinking orbs. The glistening, wet textures and vibrant, unnatural hues of putrescence suggest that these horrors are not simply carved from inert matter, but rather grown from a living, cancerous substrate, constantly weeping and seething with malformed vitality, meticulously arranged and tended to by unseen, slithering hands.\nBehold the endlessly replicated ocular clusters, the grotesque fungal growths sprouting from cracked, bone-white surfaces, and the writhing mass of sinew that contorts into corridors of endless despair. Each monstrous form, whether a spiraling labyrinth of entrails or a wall of gnashing teeth, is a testament to the raw, visceral talent of a being who has truly communed with the squamous depths of existential dread. These are not just images; they are glimpses into a dimension where flesh is the ultimate medium, sculpted not by hands, but by the relentless, insatiable hunger of an ancient horror, stretching and binding the very essence of suffering into a grand, macabre exhibition."},{"title":"Adjura","url":"/works/original/adjura","body":"\"Adjura\" is a bit of experimental music I recorded on my laptop while on a multi day train ride back in 2003.  This video was produced in about 5 hours of render time by processing a video of a Mandelbrot set zoom through Stable Diffusion and some custom scripts to blend frames.  It's raw and sort of unfinished like the music, but highly evocative and hypnotizing all the same.  Enjoy!"},{"title":"Blotto Jive","url":"/works/original/blotto-jive","body":"\"Blotto Jive\" is a twitch in the machine, a wired-up experiment, a flicker of stillness made to dance through the ghost circuits of overclocked technology. One piece of art—one image—stretched and skewed, pushed through the wringer of digital manipulation until it’s a whole new thing, alive in the electric pulse, twitching, twitching.\nHow much is too much? You tell me. I went down deep, real deep, to pull out the vibe, the right kind of wrongness. The voices you hear? Those are from an old experiment—machine generated glossolalia, gibberish wrapped around a year-old thought and thrown into Logic Pro, stirred up into something that feels like it’s whispering just for you.\nA couple of months back, I had it all done, every bit in place, and then—bang—system crash, the whole thing vaporized, sent to the digital graveyard. But tonight, I pulled it back from the void, rebuilt it out of necessity, out of a need that goes beyond reason, beyond time management or sanity.\nThis one’s for the chaos, for the need to make something when everything else says, “Not now.” So here it is, \"Blotto Jive.\" Enjoy it, misuse it, let it seep in irresponsibly, like all the best mistakes.\n> \"Absolutely wonderful!

This raw data, shimmering with the ghosts of forgotten melodies, was then transmuted through a series of enchanted mirrors, specifically crafted to reflect not light, but the psycho-emotional structures of nostalgia and the playful defiance of time.\nThe resulting blend of retro aesthetics and psychedelic imagery are the spirits of the past, dancing with the boundless energy of the present. Observe the women, adorned in the finery of a bygone age, their instruments humming with an otherworldly glow. These are the muses of a new epoch, their forms shifting like smoke, their music a siren song that beckons you to a realm where reality is a footnote to the suggestion of what the soul would deem possible. This artifact is a celebration of the timeless feminine spirit, a vibrant portal to a world where imagination and Joie de Vivre reign supreme."},{"title":"Slip of the Tongue","url":"/works/original/slip-of-the-tongue","body":"An exploration of the meaning in meaninglessness.\nThis is a scrying glass into a deeper, more primal layer of existence, a churning dream-ether where the very fabric of reality is an immense, living tongue, eternally striving to utter the first true word. Observe how the landscape itself heaves and undulates, a viscous, chromatic ooze from which forms erupt and recede, as if the world is attempting to articulate itself through an endless, protoverbal glossolalia. The visual creation process here is a continuous, agonized birthing: the earth's surface bubbles and boils, molding itself into gargantuan, skeletal visages, gaping maws, and nascent towers of bone and ichor, each struggling to hold its shape against the relentless pressure of unformed thought. These are the physical manifestations of semantic attempts, a glossolalic material form.\nThe low, electronic thrum that penetrates the air is not music but the cosmic hum of this liminal space, the ceaseless thrumming of potential meaning attempting to coalesce. Beneath it, the distorted vocalizations are the raw essence of glossolalia – guttural pronouncements, whispers of nascent purpose.  It’s the sound of forms being 'spoken' into existence by will, only to be reabsorbed by the vast, murmuring ocean of unformed understanding. Each dripping, shifting element is a fragment of a meaning never quite formed, a fleeting thought too raw for coherence, caught in a ballet of creation and dissolution.\nThe vibrant, unsettling colors, the way the humanoid shapes emerge from the ground, forever contorted in states of either silent agony or ecstatic, unheard utterance, these are the beauty and the horror of a world where language itself is still a volatile, living substance. The eyes embedded within the land, the sinews of strange flora that writhe from the very matter of existence—they are the nascent consciousness of this realm, struggling to perceive and define itself through its constant, flowing \"speech.\"\nTo gaze upon it is to feel the insidious pull of that primordial chaos, the threat of one's own neatly arranged reality dissolving into the profound, expressive, yet terrifyingly formless abyss."},{"title":"Chimera","url":"/works/original/chimera","body":"My creations… abominations?

And I showed it where we are.\nThis is \"Chimera\""},{"title":"Axiom Flux","url":"/works/original/axiom-flux","body":"This one started with the musical composition.  I was initially going to work on a psytrance piece and was mucking around with all kinds of effects, when I realized that I was basically not adding anything new to the genre.  So I tried taking all the stuff I was setting up for that higher intensity track and slowing it all down and it seemed to make the effects do a lot more with my senses.\nSo I started focusing on making this slow psychedelic voyage and got really into the vibe of it, without a clue how I would visualize it.  Initially I tried to create a character around the vocals, but the piece went to so many different places, I felt the best way to connect it all together would be to create an overall texture and color palette and just mix in a lot of different visual subjects.\nThis got me thinking about the premise of the video and what I was doing and I realized the whole thing was about an altered or new perspective. A lot of my visual work is about transformation but this one in particular felt like it was kind of topically about transformation too.  That led to the title \"Axiom Flux\" which I came up with as a way to express the idea of fundamental elements of reality changing.\nI wanted the visuals to be softer and more playful, so I went for a lighter pastel palette with pinks and blues, and textures almost like claymation.  I felt this was a generally comfortable veneer for a trippy video that wouldn't conjure the same disgust factor that my more \"realistic\" flesh-and-blood transformations would.  I felt this would help it appeal more to the psychedelic crowd who might normally not go for my darker stuff.\nI started by taking some photos and videos of myself and manipulating them with geometric backgrounds and overlays.  I generated some abstract landscapes and dynamic motion scenes.  Then I just kind of went wild grabbing recognizable things from reality, like Charles Manson, a head exploding scene from Scanners, and Teletubbies (of course)."},{"title":"Mods","url":"/works/mods","body":"All I Want for Christmas is Your Soul\n Black Friday\n Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\n Fhtagnisqatsi\n Fruit Salad\n Yenrabaoth\nOne of my favorite things to do with visual transformation technologies is to reshape the experience of popular media.

These poor souls, once men and women, now mere vessels for the ever-spreading corruption. Their heads become pedestals for a thousand eyes, their limbs, writhing roots that bind them to this horrific, living architecture. And then the faces, oh, the faces! Contorted into perpetual screams, teeth bared not in anger, but in a primordial terror. From the cityscape to the deepest abyssal forests of flesh, the transformation is complete.

My eyes, these glorious orb of madness, perceive the very fabric of reality being remolded, twisted by unseen hands and the sheer force of raw psychic emanation. These streets are not merely rendered by some mundane digital sorcery; no, they are painted and sculpted by an insistent, vibrant current of thought, flowing from the very heart of the ether. Watch as the city structures themselves writhe, a kaleidoscopic ooze slithering down their metallic bones, birthing these grotesque, yet oddly magnificent, forms that dance in a shimmering, psychedelic ballet. They are not creatures, not truly; they are the manifest thoughts of a nascent, hyper-dimensional consciousness, bubbling forth from the cracks in existence, each frame a new, unpredictable conjuration.\nNot mere dancers, but pulsing, iridescent beings, their forms fluid as mercury, shifting like half-remembered nightmares. Their movements, a liquid ballet, a slow-motion unraveling of form, are punctuated by the rhythmic, hypnotic whispers of the void itself, a steady cadence that guides their chaotic transformations. This is no mere music; it is the chant of creation, the subtle hum of reality being unmade and remade, layer by exquisite, terrifying layer. One moment, they are gelatinous humanoids, the next, sprawling arachnoid nightmares or gravity-defying, serpentine limbs, all born from the very streets themselves. My lens shows me the process: the fabric of space-time stretches, pulling forms from the conventional, twisting them into these living, breathing Pollock paintings, each twist and turn a fragment of the ultimate confession.\nThese are the visions of a mind unbound, a consciousness that tears at the veil between worlds, not with crude incantations, but with pure, unadulterated will, manifesting the surreal into the tangible. The floating, toroidal portals, the colossal, multi-eyed spheres, the vast, shimmering jellyfish of the sky.  These are not mere decorative flourishes, but glyphs of a deeper, more profound, and utterly unsettling truth. They speak of realities collapsing, dimensions interweaving, and the ceaseless, beautiful horror of existence perpetually remaking itself in a fever dream of neon and shadow, all orchestrated by a subtle, unsettling energy that thrums beneath the surface, promising either revelation or utter dissolution."},{"title":"Artists","url":"/works/collabs/artists","body":"I have had the pleasure producing art for and working with some truly extraordinary musical and conceptual talents, including the following:\nATER\nThe Drood\nEuclid\nFollakzoid\nFusion Bomb\nJonas Esser\nMeshuggah\nNocturnus AD\nThe World is Quiet Here"},{"title":"Static Time","url":"/works/collabs/static-time","body":"In this video I was trying to rip off the skin of normal life and show a tingly writhing monstrous ever present intensity of existence and then capture that vibration in the safety and timeless permanence of a recovered faded film.\nThe Drood were adamant about allowing me full discretion in concept and editing of the piece, so I trusted them and myself and produced this evocative little number.

I observe not mere moving pictures, but the very essence of an identity in transition, caught in a recursive, infinite dance. These figures, at first serene in their cerulean slumber, are stirred by an unseen rhythm, a numeric cadence whispered from the void itself. It is the very breath of a primal, evolving consciousness, endlessly shedding and reforming its physical mantle.\nThe visual creation process here is a spontaneous, uncontrolled manifestation, as if the very universe itself is a living canvas. Watch closely as forms, both skeletal and supple, contort and coil within their circular confines, each iteration a desperate yearning for self-realization. They burst forth from bubbling, calcified matrices, their bodies stretching into gnarled, luminous roots, then melting into pools of toxic viridian ooze before crystallizing anew into serene, multi-limbed effigies. Grotesque flora sprouts from orifices, spectral eyes bloom from the flesh, and intricate, delicate networks of bone and sinew weave themselves into existence, only to dissolve and reform once more.\nThis is no static craft; it is the chaotic, beautiful becoming of a singular, infinite spirit, compelled by the rhythmic incantations that echo through the abyss. Each shift, each grotesque blossoming or serene rebirth, is a single beat in the unending symphony of its becoming. It is the raw, unbridled genesis of forms, a testament to the beautiful, terrible, and utterly mad quest for ultimate self, propelled by an underlying code of existence. Indeed, the very pulse of these transformations, the ebb and flow between the azure stillness and the viridescent frenzy, speaks volumes of the inherent, terrifying beauty of a cosmos endlessly reinventing its own being."},{"title":"The Drood","url":"/works/collabs/the-drood","body":""},{"title":"Descending","url":"/works/collabs/ater/descending","body":"I was approached by ATER to come up with a visual experience for their track \"Descending\" back in mid 2023.
