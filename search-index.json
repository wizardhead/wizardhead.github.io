I won't be able to announce my new employer until then, but I did want to mention that I've worked it all out, which means that I am close to resuming operations in some all new transformative art experiences.\nHint: my new job will be in the space of developing new tools and infrastructure to support artists and musicians.  I could not be more psyched.\nIn other good news, I've nearly done getting this website in shape enough to announce it and start up the promotion and engagement machine.  I'm really interested to know how other artists out there are trying to manage their online presence beyond just posting different works on social media.  Are people out there still maintaining personal art websites or is that ancient history?\nPlease leave a comment if you know of any other artist websites that do a good job of being a portfolio and engaging with community and fans.  I'm still trying to figure it all out."},{"title":"Hello World. Again.","url":"/blog/2025/09/04/hello-world-again","body":"Greetings, programs!  I'm getting this site back online after a few month hiatus.  A lot has happened since my last activity, and I've been hard at work preparing for this new chapter.\nTo date, my Wizardhead website and social channels have been entirely relegated to releasing my art and music projects and little to nothing else.  I have, for a time, been considering publishing other kinds of content, such as tutorials and vlogs and things, but having historically had a \"pure\" feed of artwork, I found it hard to violate those expectations.\nHowever, life always has a way of tweaking things to drive change, and after YouTube and Facebook demonetized my pages and my views and subscriber numbers started decreasing, I decided to pause and reflect.\nThe pause was originally intended to be short as I actually had some new projects in the early stages, but another factor weighed in on my artistic productivity: I had to find new employment.  It may surprise some of you to know that making art is not, in fact, my full time job.  By day I work as a software engineer and the company I have worked for the past 13 years has been very strict for the past 2 of them about me badging in to their office in San Francisco 3 days a week.\nThe problem with that is that I live in Idaho and badging in requires that every week I leave my family, get on an airplane and stay in a hotel, and have to pay for it myself on top of it.  Long story short: I am completely burned out on that and I have decided to leave the company.\nUnfortunately, the process of securing a remote role with the right employer in the 2025 market has been extremely demanding of my time and attention, which has taken away the remaining time from working on art and getting the site back online.\nIt turns out that one of the companies I was interviewing for was very oriented towards front-end development in a JavaScript framework called NextJS, and as I hadn't really done much work in that, I thought I could use the project of rebuilding this site as a way to ramp up quickly.\nHalf-way through the project, and after a battery of interviews, that company came back and said they weren't going to offer me the job after all, due to some really obscure reasoning.  So I scrapped the NextJS rebuild and went with a different framework called Astro (hi, Fred) which is a much better fit for me.\nThat meant essentially rewriting most of what I'd just done, but doing so has set me up with a better platform for my needs going forward.  It still needs quite a bit of polish and I've got a ton of content to backfill, but I'm going to just put this up on the internet as soon as I can with the hope that I can fix it a little bit each day, building momentum to keep things running once I'm settled into a new routine.\nOne of the major differences I have planned for this new site, and my various social channels, is to open up and share my process, create more things in the open and build connections to people who share similar tastes and interests.  It turns out those view count numbers and subscriber count numbers are kind of meaningless on their own, but every email or comment I exchange means something real to me and I want to make more of that possible.\nSo welcome to the new website, whether you're new or been following my weird quest from the beginning.  Don't be a stranger– by all means, be as strange as you like, but just don't keep it to yourself!"},{"title":"Contact","url":"/contact","body":"Wizardhead aka Brendan Baldwin<br/>\n brendan@wizardhead.com <br/>\n ‪(208) 576-4839‬\nI don't have any kind of management or representation and the best way to reach me is just to email me.

Flesh is stretched, torn, and reformed into screaming architectural motifs and pulsating, sentient furniture.\nEach cabinet, each pipe, each wall is not merely adorned but possessed by the raw, reanimated viscera, molded into grinning skulls, endless rows of needle-sharp fangs, and globulous, unblinking orbs. The glistening, wet textures and vibrant, unnatural hues of putrescence suggest that these horrors are not simply carved from inert matter, but rather grown from a living, cancerous substrate, constantly weeping and seething with malformed vitality, meticulously arranged and tended to by unseen, slithering hands.\nBehold the endlessly replicated ocular clusters, the grotesque fungal growths sprouting from cracked, bone-white surfaces, and the writhing mass of sinew that contorts into corridors of endless despair. Each monstrous form, whether a spiraling labyrinth of entrails or a wall of gnashing teeth, is a testament to the raw, visceral talent of a being who has truly communed with the squamous depths of existential dread.

Observe how the landscape itself heaves and undulates, a viscous, chromatic ooze from which forms erupt and recede, as if the world is attempting to articulate itself through an endless, protoverbal glossolalia. The visual creation process here is a continuous, agonized birthing: the earth's surface bubbles and boils, molding itself into gargantuan, skeletal visages, gaping maws, and nascent towers of bone and ichor, each struggling to hold its shape against the relentless pressure of unformed thought. These are the physical manifestations of semantic attempts, a glossolalic material form.\nThe low, electronic thrum that penetrates the air is not music but the cosmic hum of this liminal space, the ceaseless thrumming of potential meaning attempting to coalesce. Beneath it, the distorted vocalizations are the raw essence of glossolalia – guttural pronouncements, whispers of nascent purpose.  It’s the sound of forms being 'spoken' into existence by will, only to be reabsorbed by the vast, murmuring ocean of unformed understanding. Each dripping, shifting element is a fragment of a meaning never quite formed, a fleeting thought too raw for coherence, caught in a ballet of creation and dissolution.\nThe vibrant, unsettling colors, the way the humanoid shapes emerge from the ground, forever contorted in states of either silent agony or ecstatic, unheard utterance, these are the beauty and the horror of a world where language itself is still a volatile, living substance. The eyes embedded within the land, the sinews of strange flora that writhe from the very matter of existence—they are the nascent consciousness of this realm, struggling to perceive and define itself through its constant, flowing \"speech.\"\nTo gaze upon it is to feel the insidious pull of that primordial chaos, the threat of one's own neatly arranged reality dissolving into the profound, expressive, yet terrifyingly formless abyss."},{"title":"Chimera","url":"/works/original/chimera","body":"My creations… abominations?

I was initially going to work on a psytrance piece and was mucking around with all kinds of effects, when I realized that I was basically not adding anything new to the genre.  So I tried taking all the stuff I was setting up for that higher intensity track and slowing it all down and it seemed to make the effects do a lot more with my senses.\nSo I started focusing on making this slow psychedelic voyage and got really into the vibe of it, without a clue how I would visualize it.  Initially I tried to create a character around the vocals, but the piece went to so many different places, I felt the best way to connect it all together would be to create an overall texture and color palette and just mix in a lot of different visual subjects.\nThis got me thinking about the premise of the video and what I was doing and I realized the whole thing was about an altered or new perspective. A lot of my visual work is about transformation but this one in particular felt like it was kind of topically about transformation too.  That led to the title \"Axiom Flux\" which I came up with as a way to express the idea of fundamental elements of reality changing.\nI wanted the visuals to be softer and more playful, so I went for a lighter pastel palette with pinks and blues, and textures almost like claymation.  I felt this was a generally comfortable veneer for a trippy video that wouldn't conjure the same disgust factor that my more \"realistic\" flesh-and-blood transformations would.  I felt this would help it appeal more to the psychedelic crowd who might normally not go for my darker stuff.\nI started by taking some photos and videos of myself and manipulating them with geometric backgrounds and overlays.  I generated some abstract landscapes and dynamic motion scenes.  Then I just kind of went wild grabbing recognizable things from reality, like Charles Manson, a head exploding scene from Scanners, and Teletubbies (of course)."},{"title":"Eyemad","url":"/works/original/eyemad","body":"I recorded this song way back in the 20th century and only now has the technology to construct a graphic visualization of its sonic hyperstupefication become available.\nI'm actually dancing in this video, BTW.

These streets are not merely rendered by some mundane digital sorcery; no, they are painted and sculpted by an insistent, vibrant current of thought, flowing from the very heart of the ether. Watch as the city structures themselves writhe, a kaleidoscopic ooze slithering down their metallic bones, birthing these grotesque, yet oddly magnificent, forms that dance in a shimmering, psychedelic ballet.

Their movements, a liquid ballet, a slow-motion unraveling of form, are punctuated by the rhythmic, hypnotic whispers of the void itself, a steady cadence that guides their chaotic transformations. This is no mere music; it is the chant of creation, the subtle hum of reality being unmade and remade, layer by exquisite, terrifying layer.

They burst forth from bubbling, calcified matrices, their bodies stretching into gnarled, luminous roots, then melting into pools of toxic viridian ooze before crystallizing anew into serene, multi-limbed effigies. Grotesque flora sprouts from orifices, spectral eyes bloom from the flesh, and intricate, delicate networks of bone and sinew weave themselves into existence, only to dissolve and reform once more.\nThis is no static craft; it is the chaotic, beautiful becoming of a singular, infinite spirit, compelled by the rhythmic incantations that echo through the abyss. Each shift, each grotesque blossoming or serene rebirth, is a single beat in the unending symphony of its becoming. It is the raw, unbridled genesis of forms, a testament to the beautiful, terrible, and utterly mad quest for ultimate self, propelled by an underlying code of existence.

I went to music school after high school and paid my bills by working a bunch of computer programming jobs.  Eventually I fully transitioned from telling people \"I'm a musician\" to \"I'm a software engineer\" and generally was okay with that, but it's been key theme of my midlife crisis to take the role of art in my life much more seriously.\nI started writing software professionally back in the 20th century, way before most people were even aware of a thing called “the world wide web.” I have always been fascinated by the category of software encompassing generative programming, genetic algorithms, a-life and AI.\nI have been an early stage employee working at several startup companies helping to bring (most of) them to successful exits. Some of my favorite software work has been in the open-source space, building tools to help independent developers and the next generation of startups succeed.\nI started the Wizardhead brand to channel my creative side and engage with a world beyond just the tech industry. As I work more in the arts, I find my ambitions and ideas in this domain expanding and pulling me ever more irresistibly and irrevocably towards working on art projects full-time.\nTo make it possible for me to spend more time on art, I am actively experimenting with business models and content strategies to make it sustainable.  This is messy and I have a lot to learn, so I beg your pardon in advance as I try things out."},{"title":"Blog","url":"/blog","body":"Presented in reverse-chronological order, a series of posts on whatever."}]
